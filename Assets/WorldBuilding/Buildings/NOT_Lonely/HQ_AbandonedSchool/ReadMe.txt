Hi!

Thank you for purchasing this package!


IMPORTANT!

To achieve the same graphics as in the video demo and screenshots you have to be sure that you:


1. Set your project to Deferred Rendering Path;

2. Set your project Color Space to Linear;

3. Switch your camera to HDR mode (Checkbox in the camera component);

4. Use Unity's Post Processing with the presets included (Placed in the DemoScene folder)
which you can get via the Package Manger.



>>>>>>HOW TO USE SUBSTANCES<<<<<<<

1. Download the official Substance plugin from the Asset Store: 
2. Unzip the Substnace.zip folder that placed in \Assets\NOT_Lonely\HQ_AbandonedSchool\\

Once you made this, just drag and drop any substance on any mesh (for example, MosaicFloor) and tweak properties by your taste.

This package also includes a lite version of the spetially designed tool for speed-up level building. You can find instruction for this tool inside the Readme file, placed in the appropriate folder.
One quick tip here: use ctrl + shift + R to rotate selected objects by 90 degrees along the Y axis and ctrl + shift + D to deselect all. These features are very useful when you building a level with the modular stuff =)



>>>>>>DOORS<<<<<<<

If the doors don't work, please check Console for the help info.

All the help information about the Door script 
you can find in tooltips for almost all variables and properties in the inspector.
The doors can be used with any first person controller. You just have to add a sphere trigger to your controller's camera and set the camera's tag to the same as in the doors script inspector.

>>>>>>SCRIPTABLE RENDER PIPELINES<<<<<<<

See instructions inside the "Upgrade to HDRP or URP" text file.

That's all!



If you have any other questions, please write an email: support@not-lonely.com

Don't forget to rate this pack at the Asset Store and write a review. It's very important for me!

Thank you!
